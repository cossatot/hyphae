# Hyphae

Hyphae is a graph-theoretic tool for paleoseismological data analysis and synthesis. The emphasis is on creating exhaustive scenarios of possible earthquakes and sequences of earthquake consistent with the data from many sites (and on complex fault networks), and creating relative and absolute likelihoods/probabilities for these.

Hyphae is written in Python.
